I've been excited about the idea of designing airplanes since I was a kid. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Brigham Young University, and joined the Air Force, who paid for my school. As payback for this great favor to me, I "had" to serve a four-year obligation, where I was assigned to Hill Air Force Base, Utah. I worked on A-10 mechanical systems and F-16 structures for this four-year commitment, which I enjoyed immensely. Particularly structures. I'm very drawn to the idea of maintaining aircraft structural integrity. It's all about using your math and design skills to protect the pilots and public.

During my first tour, I earned my Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Utah. I wanted to be ready at the end of my commitment to design new aircraft, not just repair them. I had planned to leave the Air Force after my four years. Plans changed when I found out that my next assignment was to Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, performing mission assurance on the Atlas V rocket. Who could turn that down? I served in the Air Force four more years in sunny Florida and learned a lot about the space launch business.

Despite loving my time in the Air Force, it was time to get out and follow my childhood dream. I now work for Leidos as an Aerospace Structural Engineer, modifying Army aircraft.

Despite my education and work experience so far, there remains a lot to learn. The pace at which projects must be turned in often gets in the way of exploring concepts more deeply, trying out different ideas, and expanding knowledge into areas that are not needed for my current projects. This website is a vehicle for me to learn more. I share what I am learning with you, because the act of teaching and writing about something drives deeper learning.

There are many great websites out there. If, in exploring a concept, I find that another website has already "hit the nail on the head," I will refer to that website. I will refer frequently to structures textbooks and articles that I consider to be "canon." I'm not sure how many of these equations and graphs I can put onto a website due to copyright issues, but I'll at least refer the reader to the section that I am using to come up with my numbers.

This website is geared towards mechanical and aerospace engineers and advanced engineering students. I'll try to explain simply, but to understand, the student will definitely need a basis in statics and mechanics of materials.

Thanks,
